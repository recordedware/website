      <p class="interview-text"><scope class="red-letter">T</scope><em>he two years since the last Marching Squares recordings allowed for certain creative growth and attention to detail. But neither did this lull restrain the vein for experimentation and stylistic idiosyncrasies. The new album is lead off by probably the strangest track of the bunch. The song, zoologically titled "Mongoose," consists, for the most part, of an empyrean viola solo over a drone of acoustic guitars and wind effects. The trademark poetics are there as well. Michael Shohet, the primary band songwriter and frontman, talks about the process and suggests some meanings for the piece. It's clear from the discussion that his creative background is rooted in literature and literary analysis. Intense critical presence in the artist's repartee confirms this essential foundation.</em></p>

      <p class="interview-text"><em>The video for "Mongoose" can be found below, after the interview. Marching Squares' third album, titled "Supreme Allied Commander," is due out in October on Recorded Ware Records.</em></p>

      <p class="interview-text"><em>The interview was conducted via a video call from the writer's flat in Dublin.</em></p>

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>The first single is an almost-instrumental, chorus-less album cut. What was the logic behind this decision?</strong></p>

      <p class="interview-text">I wanted to pick a song from the album that would make a good video. For some reason, none of the other songs germinated any visual ideas. There was an idea for "Extinction" to go to the Intrepid Museum. I would play guitar in their submarine and film it. But they closed it for the year.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>Ok, that kind of makes sense. Can you talk a little bit about the genesis of this song?</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">Yeah, I think it was 2015, and Karen [Claman (viola, vocals)] got into raga, and she wanted to cover this Indian folk song. I forget the name of it. It's famous, and there's an English version. I think it's from a movie. I tried to learn this song, but I couldn't play it. Karen is a classically trained strings player. She plays Mendelssohn and Stravinsky every day. But I couldn't handle it. So I thought it would be easier to just write my own raga song. So I studied all these Eastern and Indian scales, and this is what came out. I am not sure if I got it right. I think it sounds ok.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>It seems that you're continuing thematically from the <a href="https://marchingsquares.bandcamp.com/album/the-practice-of-emptiness">last album</a>, which also has allusions to the Far East, as well as to India. Could this be a fascination?</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">What do you mean? Like a fetish?

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>Is it not obvious that it could be interpreted as Orientalism? You have to admit that the Kipling connection is unmistakable.</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">Ok, Valerie, this is getting kind of rough. Yes, the Kipling question is very obvious.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>Did you not notice it at the moment?</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">I don't remember. I don't think so. The song went into the regular setlist, and then one day I did realize there's something wrong with it. I just laughed about it. It was this innocent song, like a lullaby. But, those do have very deep symbolism and all kinds of latent material. But I deal mostly in mythology and stories, and troubadouring, not really anything revolutionary. So I didn't really think about it. I was just happy I had this song now, and Karen could play her raga. But yeah, of course I recognize Orientalism in the mongoose. The mongoose semiotics slide into all this exoticism and all these weird allegories. And all these meanings come straight from the Kipling story. I haven't read it in a long time. I remember the mongoose is dying, and then he's rescued by a British family, right?

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>It's also mentioned that they're related to a British general. And this general lives in a nearby town.</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">That's right, thank you. So this story connects directly to the British military presence in India, and, at this time, this presence is 200 years old and at the highest level it's ever been. So yeah, basically, the white family save the mongoose by coming to India, like the British, who came to India, thought that they were saving the Indians by civilizing them. Or at least, that's how they justified the colonization. And then the mongoose, who is a native Indian, defends the British from the cobras, who are also native, but they are also, somehow, this infernal and sinister force of indigenous Indian spirituality and sexuality. So yeah, the story is extremely problematic. I'm sure I'm not the only one to say this.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>So the song is based in Kipling?</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">I guess just the mongoose imagery. The mongoose popped into my head because of the raga. And yeah, it did come from the Kipling story. Kipling pretty much monopolized mongooses to a point of banality. Kind of like Melville monopolized whales, and Poe ravens. I'm not going to lie, it felt weird using this motif. It was too obvious - Indian music, mongoose, blah blah blah. But I used it anyway. Yeah, it was a bit lazy, and maybe even thoughtless. I read that story a lot when I was young. What kid doesn't love that story? You get to have your own talking mongoose. And he fights cobras...

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>So what you're saying is you're only a product of British imperialism.</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">Yes, exactly. And we all are. And so was Kipling, right? I mean, he was born in India. And you write what you know. Listen, the signified of the mongoose is imperialist, and this can't be denied. But I think the song can reassign the mongoose to something else. I think the mongoose can be decolonized. You can unpack the song, if you feel like it.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>First of all, there's no need to apologize for Kipling. And second, it doesn't look good for the song. Especially the "jungles" part. Then, the listener is invited to look into the mongoose's eyes. The mongoose doesn't seem to have any subjective agency. She's just an object of the listener's gaze. Her eyes are fetishized, and are disembodied organs, and this further subjugates her to the listener. The listener is doing the looking. It reminds of an Edward Said quote: "The West is the actor, the Orient is a passive reactor." We see this in the song. What do you think?</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">Yeah, that's great, that's very good. But the mongoose is also beyond the listener's gaze. The listener's gaze is rendered powerless. The invocation to the listener is made for a very specific reason - so the listener can gauge reality. The mongoose is privileged. She has access to truth. And only the gaze of the mongoose can give this access.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>But the whole "soul" thing makes the mongoose something non-somatic. She's denied a body. So she's idealized and dehumanized again.</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">Valerie, how can a mongoose be dehumanized? A mongoose is not human, to begin with. I know you're messing with me right now, it's pretty funny. And the jungle - that's where mongooses live. I can't do anything about that. And it's not even a real jungle. It's a Dantean forest of inner despair and confusion. And the mongoose is not even anthropomorphized. She is not an allegory for a group of people. She is just a mongoose. She shows the interplay of body and consciousness. And this interplay could be harmonized by learning from this animal. This is what is being expressed. I think you might be missing the ecological significance, and this is the main point of this song.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>But why is the mongoose gendered female? And what about raga? Raga definitely connects to an ethnic identity. And then this identity, which is Indian, is connected to this mongoose. The mumbo jumbo about the soul sounds like a faux-Upanishads reference...</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">Ok, you're right. The song is an imperialist song. But, you don't think it's impressive that I taught myself how to write Indian folk music? And maybe this is a celebration of a culture, not an exploitation? I want to decolonize and globalize the mongoose.

      <p class="interview-text"><strong>I think you've dug yourself quite a hole here.</strong>

      <p class="interview-text">I guess I just wish that the Intrepid was open.</p>
