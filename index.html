  <h2 class="title">Decolonizing the Mongoose: A rambling conversation with Michael Shohet.</h2>

<p class="interview-text"><em>It's been almost two years since Marching Squares put out any new recordings. The new album is lead off by probably the strangest track on there, which consists, for the most part, of an empyrean viola solo over a drone of acoustic guitars and wind effects. But the trademark poetics appear as well. Michael Shohet, the primary band songwriter and frontman, talks about the process and suggests some meanings behind the piece. It's clear that his creative background is rooted in literature and literary analysis. This is confirmed by intense critical presence in the artist's responses and general interlocution.</em></p>

<p class="interview-text"><em>The video for "Mongoose" is located below, after the interview. Marching Squares' third album, titled "Supreme Allied Commander," is due out in October on Recorded Ware Records.</em></p>

<p class="interview-text"><em>The interview was conducted via a video call from the writer's flat in Dublin.</em></p>

<p class="interview-text"><strong>The first single is an almost-instrumental, chorus-less album cut. What was the logic behind this decision?</strong></p>

<p class="interview-text">I wanted to pick a song from the album that would make a good video. For some reason, none of the other songs germinated any visual ideas. There was an idea for "Sally Harmony" to go to the Intrepid Museum. I would play guitar in their submarine and film it. But they closed it for the year.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>Ok, that kind of makes sense. Can you talk a little bit about the genesis of this song?</strong>

<p class="interview-text">Yeah, I think it was sometime in 2016, Karen [Claman (viola, vocals)] got into raga, and then she wanted to do a cover of an Indian folk song. I forget the name of it, but it's famous, and there's an English version. So I tried to learn this song, but I couldn't play it. Karen is a classically trained strings player. She plays Mendelssohn and Stravinsky every day. But I couldn't handle it. So I thought it would be easier to just write my own raga song. Then I studied all these Eastern and Indian scales, and this is what came out. I am not sure if I got it right, but I think it sounds ok.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>It seems that you're continuing thematically from the <a href="https://marchingsquares.bandcamp.com/album/the-practice-of-emptiness">last album</a>, which also has allusions to the Far East, as well as to India. Could this be a fascination?</strong>

<p class="interview-text">What do you mean? Like a fetish?

<p class="interview-text"><strong>Is it not obvious that it could be interpreted as Orientalism? You have to admit that the Kipling connection is unmistakable.</strong>

<p class="interview-text">Ok, Valerie, this is getting rough. Yes, the Kipling question is very obvious.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>Did you not notice it at the moment?</strong>

<p class="interview-text">I don't remember. I don't think so. Or at least, not whileI was writing it. The song went into the regular setlist, and then I realized it might be colonialist. I just laughed about it and kind of brushed it off. To me it was an innocent song, like a lullaby. I deal mostly in mythology and stories, and troubadouring, not really any revolution. But yeah, of course I recognize the Orientalism in the mongoose. The mongoose semiotics slide into all this exoticism and all these weird allegories. And all these meanings, they all come from the Kipling story. I haven't read it in a long time, but I remember the mongoose gets rescued by a British family, who live in India. Is that right?

<p class="interview-text"><strong>It's also mentioned that they're related to a British general. And this general lives in a nearby town.</strong>

<p class="interview-text">That's right, thank you. So this story connects directly to the British military presence in India, and, at this time, this presence is almost 300 years old and at the highest level. So yeah, basically, the white family save the mongoose by coming to India, like the British, who came to India, thought that they were saving the Indians by civilizing them. And then the mongoose, who is a native Indian, defends the British from the cobras, who are also native, but they are also, somehow, this infernal and sinister force of indigenous Indian spirituality and sexuality. The story is extremely problematic, and of course, I am not the only one to say this.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>So the song is based in Kipling?</strong>

<p class="interview-text">To some degree. Just the mongoose imagery. The mongoose popped into my head because of the raga. And yeah, I guess it did come from the Kipling story. Kipling pretty much monopolized mongooses to a point of banality. Kind of like Melville monopolized whales, and Poe ravens. I'm not going to lie, it felt weird using this motif. It seemed too easy and too obvious. But I used it anyway. I read that story a lot when I was very young. What kid doesn't love that story? You get to have your own talking mongoose. And he fights cobras...

<p class="interview-text"><strong>So what you're saying is you are only a product of British imperialism.</strong>

<p class="interview-text">Yes, exactly. And we all are. And so was Kipling, no? I mean, he was born in India, right? And you write what you know. Listen, the signified of the mongoose is imperialist. I don't deny this. But I think this song can reassign the mongoose to something else. I think the mongoose can be decolonized. You can unpack the song, if you feel like it.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>First of all, no need to apologize for Kipling. And second, it doesn't look good for the song. Especially the "jungles" part. Then, the listener is invited to look into the eyes of the mongoose. The mongoose doesn't seem to have any subjective agency. She's just an object of the listener's gaze. Her eyes are fetishized, and are disembodied organs, and this further subjugates her to the listener. The listener is doing the looking. It reminds of an Edward Said quote: "The West is the actor, the Orient is a passive reactor." We see this in the song. Is this ok?</strong>

<p class="interview-text">Yeah, that's great, that's very good. But the mongoose is also beyond the gaze. The gaze is rendered powerless. The invocation to the listener is made for a very specific reason - so the listener can gauge reality. The mongoose has access to truth. She is privileged. And only the gaze of the mongoose can give this access.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>But the whole "soul" thing makes the mongoose something non-somatic. She's denied a body. So she's idealized and dehumanized again.</strong>

<p class="interview-text">Valerie, how can a mongoose be dehumanized? A mongoose is not human, to begin with. I know you're messing with me right now. Yes, it's pretty funny. And the jungle - that's where mongooses live. I can't do anything about it. And it's not even a real jungle, but a Dantean forest of inner confusion and despair. And the mongoose is not even anthropomorphized. She is not an allegory for a group of people. She is just a mongoose. She displays the interplay of body and consciousness. And this interplay could be harmonized by learning from this animal. This is what is being expressed. I think you might be missing the ecological and zoological elements, and these are the main points of this song.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>But why is the mongoose gendered female? And what about raga? Raga definitely connects to an ethnic identity. And then this identity, which is Indian, is connected to this mongoose. The mumbo jumbo about the soul sounds like a faux-Upanishads reference...</strong>

<p class="interview-text">Ok, you're right. The song is an imperialist song. But, do you not think it's impressive that I taught myself how to write Indian folk music? And maybe this is a celebration of a culture, not an exploitation? I want to decolonize and globalize the mongoose.

<p class="interview-text"><strong>I think you've dug yourself quite a hole here.</strong>

<p class="interview-text">I guess I just wish that the Intrepid was open.</p>
